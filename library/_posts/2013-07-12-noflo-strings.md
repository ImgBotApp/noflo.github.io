String Utilities for NoFlo [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/noflo/noflo-strings.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/noflo/noflo-strings)
===============================

This package provides utility components to manipulate strings in
[NoFlo](http://noflojs.org/).

Feel free to contribute new components and graphs! I'll try to
incorporate as soon as time allows.
