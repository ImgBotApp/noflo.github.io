Graphs are the way a NoFlo program is defined. A graph has a set of nodes, each representing an instance of a component or another graph, and edges connecting their ports to each other.

## JSON

In addition to using NoFlo in _embedded mode_ where you create the FBP graph programmatically ([see example](https://raw.github.com/noflo/noflo/master/examples/linecount/count.coffee)), you can also initialize and run graphs defined using a JSON file.

The NoFlo JSON files declare the processes used in the FBP graph, and the connections between them. They look like the following:

```json
{
  "properties": {
    "name": "Count lines in a file"
  },
  "processes": {
    "Read File": {
      "component": "ReadFile",
      "metadata": {
        ...
      }
    },
    "Split by Lines": {
      "component": "SplitStr"
    },
    ...
  },
  "connections": [
    {
      "data": "package.json",
      "tgt": {
        "process": "Read File",
        "port": "source"
      }
    },
    {
      "src": {
        "process": "Read File",
        "port": "out"
      },
      "tgt": {
        "process": "Split by Lines",
        "port": "in"
      }
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

Please refer to the [Graph JSON Schema](https://github.com/flowbased/fbp/blob/master/schema/graph.json) for full definition.

## FBP

In addition to the JSON format described above, FBP has its own Domain-Specific Language (DSL) for easy graph definition. The syntax is the following:

* `'somedata' -> PORT Process(Component)` sends initial data _somedata_ to port _PORT_ of process _Process_ that runs component _Component_
* `A(Component1) X -> Y B(Component2)` sets up a connection between port _X_ of process _A_ that runs component _Component1_ and port _Y_ of process _B_ that runs component _Component2_

You can connect multiple components and ports together on one line, and separate connection definitions with a newline or a comma (`,`).

You can find more information in the [README of the stand-alone FBP parser](https://github.com/noflo/fbp#readme).

Example:

```fbp
'somefile.txt' -> SOURCE Read(ReadFile) OUT -> IN Split(SplitStr)
Split OUT -> IN Count(Counter) COUNT -> IN Display(Output)
Read ERROR -> IN Display
```

### Converting FBP to JSON

The [FBP tool](https://github.com/flowbased/fbp) can be used to convert your FBP to JSON. Start by installing the command-line tool:

```bash
$ npm install -g fbp
```

Now you can convert a `.fbp` graph to JSON by running:

```bash
$ fbp path/to/graph.fbp
```

This will output the graph to standard out. Write it to a file with:

```bash
$ fbp path/to/graph.fbp > path/to/graph.json
```

## Subgraphs

A NoFlo graph may contain multiple subgraphs, managed by instances of the `Graph` component. Subgraphs are useful for packaging particular flows to be used as a "new component" by other flows. This allows building more advanced functionality by creating reusable graphs of connected components.

The Graph component loads the graph given to it as a new NoFlo network, and looks for unattached ports in it. It then exposes these ports as its own inports or outports. This way a graph containing subgraphs can easily connect data between the main graph and the subgraph.

Unattached ports from the subgraph will be available through naming `ProcessName.port` on the Graph component instance.

A simple example, using a subgraph as a component by splitting [linecount example fbp](https://github.com/noflo/noflo/blob/master/examples/linecount/count.fbp) into two files:

### Count
```coffeescript
# File: graphs/count.fbp
INPORT=Read.IN:FILENAME
OUTPORT=Count.COUNT:COUNT
OUTPORT=Read.ERROR:ERROR

# Split the file contents by newlines
Read(ReadFile) OUT -> IN Split(SplitStr)
# Count the packets
Split() OUT -> IN Count(Counter)
```

### Main
```coffeescript
# File: graphs/main.fbp

# Read a file (using our subgraph defined above)
'package.json' -> IN Count(Count)
Count() COUNT -> IN Display(Output)

# Display also file read errors
Count() ERROR -> IN Display()
```

A more advanced example, specifying what file a spreadsheet-parsing subgraph should run with:

```coffeescript
# Load a subgraph as a new process
'examples/spreadsheet/parse.fbp' -> GRAPH Reader(Graph)
# Send the filename to the component (subgraph)
'somefile.xls' -> READ.SOURCE Reader()
# Display the results
Reader() ENTITIZE.OUT -> IN Display(Output)
```

Just like with components, it is possible to share subgraphs via NPM. Just make sure they're contained in the `graphs/` subdirectory of your package.

After this the subgraph is available as a "virtual component" with the name `spreadsheet/Parse` and can be used just like any other component. Subgraphs exported in this manner can be in either JSON or the `.fbp` format.

## Executing graphs

To run a graph file, you can either use the [noflo-nodejs tool](https://github.com/noflo/noflo-nodejs):

```bash
$ noflo-nodejs example.json
```

Graphs can also be executed programmatically:

```javascript
var noflo = require("noflo");
noflo.loadFile("example.json", function(err, network) {
  if (err) {
    throw err;
  }
  console.log("Graph loaded");
  console.log(network.graph.toDOT());
});
```

### Inline FBP in web applications

In addition to separate files, FBP graph definitions can also be defined inline in HTML. The typical way to do this is to utilize a `script` tag. For example, the following would change the contents of an element identified with the ID `header` to say *Hello World*:

```html
<script type="application/fbp" id="main">
  '#header' -> SELECTOR GetHeader(dom/GetElement)
  'Hello World' -> HTML WriteContent(dom/WriteHTML)
  GetHeader ELEMENT -> CONTAINER WriteContent
</script>
```

Loading and running inline FBP is quite simple:

```javascript
// Get the FBP contents
var fbp = document.getElementById('main').textContent.trim();

// Load the NoFlo graph based on the FBP string
noflo.graph.loadFBP(fbp, function (err, graph) {
  if (err) {
    // Throw on parse errors
    throw err;
  }

  // Run the graph
  noflo.createNetwork(graph, function (err, network) {
    if (err) {
      // Throw if network can't be initialized
      throw err;
    }
    console.log('Network is running!');
  });
});
```
