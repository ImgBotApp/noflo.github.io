The Flow-Based Programming network protocol (*FBP protocol*) has been designed primarily for flow-based programming interfaces like the [NoFlo UI](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/noflo/noflo-development-environment) to communicate with various FBP runtimes. However, it can also be utilized for communication between different runtimes, for example server-to-server or server-to-microcontroller.

## Basics

The FBP protocol is a message-based protocol that can be handled using various different transport mechanisms. The messages are designed to be independent, and not to form a request-response cycle in order to allow highly asynchronous operations and situations where multiple protocol clients talk with the same runtime.

There are currently two transports utilized commonly:

* [Web Messaging](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Messaging) (`postMessage`) for communication between different web pages or WebWorkers running inside the same browser instance
* [WebSocket](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket) for communicating between a browser and a server, or between two server instances

Different transports can be utilized as needed. It could be interesting to implement the FBP protocol using [MQTT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MQ_Telemetry_Transport), for instance.

### Sub-protocols

The FBP protocol is divided into three sub-protocols, or "channels":

* `graph`: communications about graph changes
* `component`: communications about available components and changes to them
* `network`: communications related to running a FBP graph

### Message structure

This document describes all messages as the data structures that are passed. The way these are encoded depends on the transport being used. For example, with WebSockets all messages are encoded as stringified JSON.

All messages consist of three parts:

* Sub-protocol identifier (`graph`, `component`, or `network`)
* Topic (for example, `addnode`)
* Message payload (typically a data structure specific to the sub-protocol and topic)

The keys listed in specific messages are for the message payloads. The values are strings unless stated differently.

## Graph protocol

This protocol is utilized for communicating about graph changes in both directions.

### `clear`

Initialize an empty graph.

* `name`: identifier for the graph being created. Used for all subsequent messages related to the graph instance
* `baseDir` (optional): root for finding component dependencies for the graph. In case for server-side NoFlo graph, a directory path

### `addnode`

Add node to a graph.

* `id`: identifier for the node
* `component`: component name used for the node
* `metadata` (optional): structure of key-value pairs for node metadata
* `graph`: graph the action targets

### `removenode`

Remove a node from a graph.

* `id`: identifier for the node
* `graph`: graph the action targets

### `renamenode`

Change the ID of a node in the graph

* `from`: original identifier for the node
* `to`: new identifier for the node
* `graph`: graph the action targets

### `addedge`

Add an edge to the graph

* `from`: source node for the edge
  - `node`: node identifier
  - `port`: port name
* `to`: target node for the edge
  - `node`: node identifier
  - `port`: port name
* `metadata` (optional): structure of key-value pairs for edge metadata
* `graph`: graph the action targets

### `removeedge`

Remove an edge from the graph

* `from`: source node for the edge
  - `node`: node identifier
  - `port`: port name
* `to`: target node for the edge
  - `node`: node identifier
  - `port`: port name
* `graph`: graph the action targets

### `addinitial`

Add an IIP to the graph

* `from`:
  - `data`: IIP value in its actual data type
* `to`: target node for the edge
  - `node`: node identifier
  - `port`: port name
* `metadata` (optional): structure of key-value pairs for edge metadata
* `graph`: graph the action targets

### `removeinitial`

Remove an IIP from the graph

* `to`: target node for the edge
  - `node`: node identifier
  - `port`: port name
* `graph`: graph the action targets

## Component protocol

Protocol for handling the component registry.

### `list`

Request a list of currently available components.

### `component`

Transmit the metadata about a component instance.

* `name`: component name in format that can be used in graphs
* `description` (optional): textual description on what the component does
* `icon` (optional): visual icon for the component, matching icon names in [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons/)
* `inPorts`: list of input ports, each containing:
  - `id`: port name
  - `type`: port datatype, for example `boolean`
  - `array`: boolean telling whether the port is an ArrayPort
* `outPorts`: list of output ports, each containing:
  - `id`: port name
  - `type`: port datatype, for example `boolean`
  - `array`: boolean telling whether the port is an ArrayPort
