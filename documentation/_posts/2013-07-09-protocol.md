title: FBP Network Protocol
layout: documentation
---
The Flow-Based Programming network protocol (*FBP protocol*) has been designed primarily for flow-based programming interfaces like the [NoFlo UI](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/noflo/noflo-development-environment) to communicate with various FBP runtimes. However, it can also be utilized for communication between different runtimes, for example server-to-server or server-to-microcontroller.

## Basics

The FBP protocol is a message-based protocol that can be handled using various different transport mechanisms. The messages are designed to be independent, and not to form a request-response cycle in order to allow highly asynchronous operations and situations where multiple protocol clients talk with the same runtime.

There are currently two transports utilized commonly:

* [Web Messaging](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Messaging) (`postMessage`) for communication between different web pages or WebWorkers running inside the same browser instance
* [WebSocket](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket) for communicating between a browser and a server, or between two server instances

Different transports can be utilized as needed. It could be interesting to implement the FBP protocol using [MQTT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MQ_Telemetry_Transport), for instance.

### Sub-protocols

The FBP protocol is divided into three sub-protocols, or "channels":

* `graph`: communications about graph changes
* `component`: communications about available components and changes to them
* `network`: communications related to running a FBP graph

### Message structure

This document describes all messages as the data structures that are passed. The way these are encoded depends on the transport being used. For example, with WebSockets all messages are encoded as stringified JSON.

All messages consist of three parts:

* Sub-protocol identifier (`graph`, `component`, or `network`)
* Topic (for example, `addnode`)
* Message payload (typically a data structure specific to the sub-protocol and topic)

The keys listed in specific messages are for the message payloads. The values are strings unless stated differently.

## Graph protocol

This protocol is utilized for communicating about graph changes in both directions.

### `clear`

Initialize an empty graph.

* `id`: identifier for the graph being created. Used for all subsequent messages related to the graph instance
* `name`: (optional) Human-readable label for the graph
* `library`: (optional) Component library identifier
* `main`: (optional) Identifies the graph as a main graph of a project that should not be registered as a component

Graphs registered in this way should also be available for use as subgraphs in other graphs. Therefore a graph registration and later changes to it may cause `component` messages of the [Component protocol](#component) to be sent back to the client informing of possible changes in the ports of the subgraph component.

### `addnode`

Add node to a graph.

* `id`: identifier for the node
* `component`: component name used for the node
* `metadata` (optional): structure of key-value pairs for node metadata
* `graph`: graph the action targets

### `removenode`

Remove a node from a graph.

* `id`: identifier for the node
* `graph`: graph the action targets

### `renamenode`

Change the ID of a node in the graph

* `to`: new identifier for the node

### `addedge`

* `src`: source node for the edge
  - `node`: node identifier
  - `port`: port name
* `tgt`: target node for the edge
  - `node`: node identifier

### `getsource`

Request for the source code of a given component. Will be responded with a `source` message.

* `name`: Name of the component to get source code for

### `source`

Source code for a component. In cases where a runtime receives a `source` message, it should do whatever operations are needed for making that component available for graphs, including possible compilation.

* `name`: Name of the component
