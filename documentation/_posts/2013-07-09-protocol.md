title: FBP Network Protocol
layout: documentation
---
The Flow-Based Programming network protocol (*FBP protocol*) has been designed primarily for flow-based programming interfaces like the [NoFlo UI](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/noflo/noflo-development-environment) to communicate with various FBP runtimes. However, it can also be utilized for communication between different runtimes, for example server-to-server or server-to-microcontroller.

## Basics

The FBP protocol is a message-based protocol that can be handled using various different transport mechanisms. The messages are designed to be independent, and not to form a request-response cycle in order to allow highly asynchronous operations and situations where multiple protocol clients talk with the same runtime.

There are currently two transports utilized commonly:

* [Web Messaging](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Messaging) (`postMessage`) for communication between different web pages or WebWorkers running inside the same browser instance
* [WebSocket](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket) for communicating between a browser and a server, or between two server instances

Different transports can be utilized as needed. It could be interesting to implement the FBP protocol using [MQTT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MQ_Telemetry_Transport), for instance.

### Sub-protocols

The FBP protocol is divided into three sub-protocols, or "channels":

* `graph`: communications about graph changes
* `component`: communications about available components and changes to them
* `network`: communications related to running a FBP graph

### Message structure

This document describes all messages as the data structures that are passed. The way these are encoded depends on the transport being used. For example, with WebSockets all messages are encoded as stringified JSON.

All messages consist of three parts:

* Sub-protocol identifier (`graph`, `component`, or `network`)
* Topic (for example, `addnode`)
* Message payload (typically a data structure specific to the sub-protocol and topic)

The keys listed in specific messages are for the message payloads. The values are strings unless stated differently.
