We're excited to launch the IDE for flow-based programming at http://flowhub.io/ some time in the future. 

![screen shot of Flowhub IDE 2014-04-03](ScreenShot-2014-04-03.png)

If you're brave and would like to help us find bugs, try the [getting started guide](http://flowhub.io/documentation/getting-started-browser/). Submit bugs to the [issue tracker](https://github.com/noflo/noflo-ui/issues) and feedback (both positive and constructive) to [forrest@thegrid.io](mailto:forrest@thegrid.io?subject=flowhub-ide).

If you're *really* brave and would like to run it on your own machine, see the build instructions on the [noflo-ui Github repository](https://github.com/noflo/noflo-ui).
