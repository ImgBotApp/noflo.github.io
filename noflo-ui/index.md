We're excited to launch the IDE for flow-based programming at [flowhub.io](https://flowhub.io/) this year.

[![screen shot of Flowhub IDE 2014-04-03](ScreenShot-2014-04-03.png)](https://app.flowhub.io)

If you're interested in trying the new UI, take a look at the [getting started guide](https://docs.flowhub.io/getting-started-browser/).

* Submit bugs to the [issue tracker](https://github.com/noflo/noflo-ui/issues)
* Send feedback to [support@flowhub.io](mailto:support@flowhub.io)

If you're *really* brave and would like to run it on your own machine, see the build instructions on the [noflo-ui Github repository](https://github.com/noflo/noflo-ui).
