We're excited to launch an IDE for flow-based programming at http://flowhub.io/ some time in the fall. 

If you're brave and would like to help us find bugs, try the [getting started guide](http://flowhub.io/documentation/getting-started-browser/). Submit bugs to the [issue tracker](https://github.com/noflo/noflo-ui/issues) and feedback (both positive and constructive) to [forrest@thegrid.io](mailto:forrest@thegrid.io?subject=flowhub-ide).
